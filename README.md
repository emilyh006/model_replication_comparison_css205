## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for a statistical replication of Study 3 from _“Equality, Reciprocity, or Need? Bolstering Welfare Policy Support for Marginalized Groups with Distributive Fairness”_ by Findor et al. (2022), published in _American Political Science Review_.

Study 3 investigates the effects of different distributive fairness principles (equality, reciprocity, need) on Slovak citizens’ support for social housing policies targeting the Roma minority. We replicate the ordinal logistic regression analyses, reproduce all key findings, and test alternative model specifications that incorporate attitudinal predictors.
